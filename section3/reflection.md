## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

One of the things that struck me was the speaker pointing out the difference between the fixed mindset ("You are what you are and that's it.") versus a growth mindset  ("what you are now is just what you are now, but you can grow into something more"

Another thing that I took away was that mistakes are an essential part of learning and that one should adopt this attitude so that one doesn't get discouraged by mistakes.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I generally do believe that I am capable of learning new skills if I set myself to it.

One area I could improve on is seeking out help from mentors and others who know more than me.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

A hash is a group of key-value pairs, where each key has a unique value. It is different than an array in that the value assigned is not a numbered order like an array; it is an arbitrary assignment.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

pet_store = {kibble: 23, bits: 507, fish_food: 48}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

$puts states['IA']

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

p states.values
p states.keys

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

An example might be the sender email address assigned to a sender name in a hash of email metadata. It's better than assigning an integer to that information because that would not be helpful.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
No questions, just interested in learning about more advanced situations.
