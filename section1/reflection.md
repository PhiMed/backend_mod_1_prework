## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
The idea of learning as a process rather than a destination resonated with me; I feel like this is how I view the learning process already. I'm already pretty good at habits 5 and 6 (taking care of one's brain and taking short breaks as needed). I would like to explore habit 4 more; being able to teach someone else is impossible unless the teacher understands and has achieved proficiency in the topic.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

puts "Hello World!"

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

#

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

An integer can only be a whole number, like "5", a float can have decimal places.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

animal = "zebra"

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

puts animal

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

Interpolation essentially involves a place-holder variable that is replaced with a value in the final product.

animal = "zebra"

puts "#{animal} are closely related to horses."

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

gets.chomp

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

Some methods include suffixes added to the end of the string, for instance:
```
$puts variable.upcase
```
would output whatever string is assigned to "variable" in uppercase

Another example would be ".chomp" which removes the newline character from a string, so that it does not go to a new line automatically when executed.
